### Description about the project

This is a pretty standard Jekyll website. The best way to get an idea of its function is to take a look at the official Jekyll documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and go through the tutorial [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme).
